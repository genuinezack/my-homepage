        I was initially brought on as a freelance advisor to help shape the initial build for{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://www.additionwealth.com">Addition Wealth</ExternalLink>&rquo;s

        I helped craft our product process, shape the features we chose to develop, and lead a team
        of contractor engineers during the initial product build. Since then, I&rsquo;ve stayed on
        the team to help them grow the product and team into a stable company. I currently work with
        the company on a long-term contract as the founding architect and lead engineer.
