# Zack's Homepage

This repo holds the code that runs [my homepage](https://zacksheppard.com).

This is the third generation of my homepage. It used to be a lightweight Node server serving raw HTML
on Heroku, then I ported it to [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) 4
on Firebase. This year I fell in love with [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/) and
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and I wanted to move to using an original design rather than just
a Bootstrap template, so I rewrote it again. That's this version.

This is mostly here so you can see my code, not so you can clone it. It is open source, though, so feel
free to take it and use it as reference or inspiration. Just, like, if you are going to clone it, change
it so you're not me anymore.
