my-homepage
===========

This repo holds the code that runs [my homepage](http://zacksheppard.com).

It uses Node to power a simple static server so that I can run it for free on [Heroku](http://heroku.com).

I got the basics of the server from [this Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6084360/using-node-js-as-a-simple-web-server). I added a startup loop that will process all the LESS files in `static/less`.

The design is modified from [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)'s Cover template for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

This is mostly here so you can see my code, not so you can clone it. If you are going to clone it,
change the data so you're not me anymore.
