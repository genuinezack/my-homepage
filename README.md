Zack's Homepage
===========

This repo holds the code that runs [my homepage](https://zacksheppard.com).

Originally, this included a lightweight node server, but nowadays you can just host things for free on [Firebase](https://firebase.com), so that's what I do.

I have included the boilerplate for a React app, in case I want to add more complicated features later. Right now, there's only a tiny bit of Javascript used for dynamic features.

The site's design is modified from @BlackrockDigital's [Resume template](https://github.com/blackrockDigital/startbootstrap-resume/)
for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

This is mostly here so you can see my code, not so you can clone it. If you are going to clone it,
change the data so you're not me anymore and aren't sending me your Google Analytics data.
